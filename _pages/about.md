Hi! I am a second year M.Sc. student at Paris-Saclay University in the department of mathematics.
I am mainly interested in optimization for machine learning.

Previously, I spent the first year of my master's in the machine learning lab at the University of British Columbia, where I was advised by [Mark Schmidt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/).

I obtained my Bachelors degree in mathematics and computer science at McGill University in 2018. During my final year, I was supervised by [Tim Hoheisel](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/). We mostly worked on various versions of the Fermat-Weber location problem.
