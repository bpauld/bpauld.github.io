I am a postdoctoral researcher within the Inria [DISCO team](https://team.inria.fr/disco/), working closely with the EDF R&D teams as part of the joint [Inria-EDF challenge](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-edf). My work focuses on designing large-scale optimization methods for managing power systems.

Prior to that, I obtained a Ph.D. from [ENS](https://www.di.ens.fr/), where I was part of the Inria [Sierra team](https://sierra-mlopt.github.io/), and was supervised by [Alexandre d'Aspremont](https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/).

Previously, I spent a year in the machine learning lab at the University of British Columbia, where I was advised by [Mark Schmidt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/).

I obtained my Bachelors degree in mathematics and computer science at McGill University in 2018. During my final year, I was supervised by [Tim Hoheisel](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/). We mostly worked on various versions of the Fermat-Weber location problem.
