Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [Alexandre d'Aspremont](https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/). I am part of the [SIERRA team](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/index.php), a joint project between [ENS](https://www.di.ens.fr/), [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris) and [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/fr/page-daccueil).


Previously, I spent a year in the machine learning lab at the University of British Columbia, where I was advised by [Mark Schmidt](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/).

I obtained my Bachelors degree in mathematics and computer science at McGill University in 2018. During my final year, I was supervised by [Tim Hoheisel](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/hoheisel/). We mostly worked on various versions of the Fermat-Weber location problem.
