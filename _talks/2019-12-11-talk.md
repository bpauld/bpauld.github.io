My first talk at UBC!\
The topic for this semester at the machine learning seminar was to (try to) better understand why deep learning works so well.\
In this talk I presented and discussed a paper dealing with generalization bounds for neural networks.

You can look at the slides [here](https://bpauld.github.io/files/MLRG1.pdf).
