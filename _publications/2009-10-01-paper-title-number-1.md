title: "Acceleration with Stochastic Linear Coupling"
collection: publications
---

In this work, we investigated how the linear coupling algorithm could be extended to the stochastic setting.
In particular, we show that stochastic linear coupling under a strong growth condition achieves an accelerated rate for the optimization of smooth (non-strongly) convex functions.
