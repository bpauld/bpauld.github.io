This is the report from the summer I spent as a research assistant at McGill in 2018.\
This was my first experience in research in optimization!\
I investigated the famous Fermat-Weber location problem under different norms.\
You can read the report [here](https://bpauld.github.io/files/Fermat_Weber_Problem.pdf).
